# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Security-First Architecture Compliance
- [ ] SSH credentials handled securely through Electron security model
- [ ] File operations validate paths and permissions
- [ ] AI functionality includes dangerous command detection
- [ ] API keys configurable through YAML settings

### Cross-Platform Desktop Application Compliance
- [ ] Electron-based architecture for Windows/macOS/Linux
- [ ] Responsive UI across different screen sizes
- [ ] Native desktop features appropriately utilized

### Modular Component Architecture Compliance
- [ ] Vue 3 Composition API with separation of concerns
- [ ] Single-purpose, independently testable components
- [ ] SCSS design token system consistently applied

### Test-Driven Development Compliance
- [ ] Playwright framework for end-to-end tests
- [ ] Automated test coverage for critical user journeys
- [ ] Tests executable in development and CI environments

### Integrated AI Assistant Compliance
- [ ] Multiple AI provider integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, custom APIs)
- [ ] Natural language to safe shell command translation
- [ ] Seamless provider switching and configuration management

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
